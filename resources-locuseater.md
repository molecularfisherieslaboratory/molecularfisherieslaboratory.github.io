This version fixes the following bugs: a bug that occurs when the loci are not ordered on allele sizes in the user file input that caused some feasible batch strategies not to be found; a number of spelling mistakes; a bug that caused the program to crash in Version 1.3 when you deleted a strategy; a bug that meant the progress bar disappeared after you changed focus to other software and then came back to LocusEater. This version adds the option to stimulate with a related population for a given effective size (Ne).

# Product information
Genetic mark-recapture, or gene tagging, requires efficient methods of uniquely identifying individuals. ‘Shadows’ (individuals with the same genotype at the selected loci) can bias harvest rate estimates for managed resources. Panels of microsatellite loci can be designed to minimise the number of shadows appearing, but this aspect of panel design is a complex multiple-component optimisation process. LocusEater will automate this process by simulating the entire genetic mark-recapture experiment, from panel design to harvest-rate estimation and perform a power analysis to estimate the level of sampling and processing required for a given level of precision in harvest rate estimates.
