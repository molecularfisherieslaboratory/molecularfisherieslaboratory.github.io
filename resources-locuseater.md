### Version 2.3 Updates

This version fixes the following issues:

- Bug that occurred when loci were not ordered by allele sizes in the user input file, causing some feasible batch strategies not to be found.  
- Several spelling mistakes.  
- Crash bug in Version 1.3 when deleting a strategy.  
- Progress bar disappearing after changing focus away from LocusEater.  

**New feature:**  
Added the option to simulate with a related population for a given effective size (Ne).

## Product Information

Genetic mark-recapture (gene tagging) requires efficient methods of uniquely identifying individuals. *Shadows* — individuals sharing identical genotypes at selected loci — can bias harvest rate estimates for managed resources.  

Panels of microsatellite loci can be designed to minimize the number of shadows, but this design process is a complex multi-component optimization task.  

**LocusEater** automates this process by simulating the entire genetic mark-recapture experiment — from panel design to harvest-rate estimation — and performs a power analysis to estimate the sampling and processing effort needed to achieve a desired precision in harvest rate estimates.
