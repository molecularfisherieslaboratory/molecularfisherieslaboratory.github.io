## Product Information

**NeOGen** (genetic *Ne* for Overlapping Generations; pronounced *Neo-gen*) is point-and-click genetic effective population size (*Ne*) and demographic modelling software.  

Originally designed for sharks, it is applicable to many overlapping-generation species with moderate to low population sizes and fecundity (such as mammals).  

NeOGen provides a cohesive linkage disequilibrium genetic Ne estimate (Ne.LD) analysis and simulation framework that models both demography and genetic composition, given a small subset of life-history, demographic, and genetic priors.  

It then guides researchers *in silico* to design a tractable sampling regime — determining the number of samples and loci required to obtain accurate and precise Ne.LD estimates when empirical sampling is performed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Is there a version of NeOGen available for Linux or macOS?  
**A:** Not yet. Cross-platform versions are planned for future releases.  

**Q:** How do I get a copy of NeOGen?  
**A:** [DOWNLOAD – Please register your details before downloading this software](https://forms.gle/nAG8pxqjkFKiUfgY7).  

**Q:** How do I install NeOGen once downloaded?  
**A:** Follow these steps:

1. Download the Setup `.exe` file.  
2. Double-click the Setup file to start installation.  
3. Choose an installation directory (default recommended).  
   - **Do not** install to Windows system folders (e.g., `C:\Windows\Program Files`).  
   - Install to a **permanent drive** (not USB or removable).  
4. Follow the prompts to complete setup (use default values).  
5. Launch NeOGen via the desktop/start-menu shortcut — **not** `NOGP.exe`.
