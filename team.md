## Jennifer Ovenden
Jennifer Ovenden is the founder of the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory. In 2020, she retired from full-time work. In recognition of her significant contributions to the understanding, sustainable use, and conservation of chondrichthyans in the Oceania region, Dr. Ovenden was honored with the  Oceania Chondrichthyan Society (OCS) Lifetime Achievement and Membership Award in 2022. While she no longer leads the laboratory's day-to-day operations, her legacy continues to influence our research. The Molecular Fisheries Laboratory remains active, focusing on population genetics and genomics to inform sustainable fisheries management. 


## Christine Dudgeon
Currently, Chris leads the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory, continuing to advance research on marine population ecology, including her ongoing work with lepoard sharks and various other marine life. Chris’ work focusses on the ecology and evolution of marine populations and species, and their application to conservation and fisheries management. Chris employs a suite of techniques including genetics, acoustic telemetry, conventional and natural tagging (mark-recapture), and statistical modelling to investigate what comprises a population for marine species and how this changes in space and time, as well as identifying species and speciation processes. Chris obtained her undergraduate and honours degrees at James Cook University (JCU) and subsequently worked as a research assistant at JCU and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Chris obtained her PhD at The University of Queensland (UQ) focusing on the ecology of the zebra shark in association with The Molecular Fisheries Laboratory (completed 2009).


## Jess Morgan 
Jess has extensive experience working with DNA sequences from nuclear and mitochondrial genes and has also worked with mircrosatellites, SNPs, real-time PCR and quantitative PCR and more!


## Andy Moore 
Andy is a scientist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES). Dr. Andy Moore is a fisheries scientist with over 20 years of experience in fisheries science and management. He currently holds a position at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), where he contributes to research and policy development in the field of fisheries.

## Other active members:
### Dani Davenport
Dani is an alumna of the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory, where she focused on population genomics for marine conservation. She is now a postdoctoral fellow at Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

### Dean Blower
Dean Blower, and an alumna of the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory, is a molecular genomics and computational biology specialist currently associated with Tern BioTec and the University of Queensland. His work integrates genomic data with computational tools to address complex biological questions.

### Andrew Jones 
Dr. Andrew Jones is a Senior Statistician at the Centre for Health Services Research at The University of Queensland. His research interests include statistical modeling, machine learning, and data analytics, with applications in health services and population genetics. Dr. Jones has collaborated with the Molecular Fisheries Laboratory on projects involving genetic data analysis and effective population size estimation in marine species. His work contributes to the understanding of population dynamics and informs conservation strategies for marine biodiversity.
